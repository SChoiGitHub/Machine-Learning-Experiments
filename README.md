# Machine Learning Experiments

These are my personal experiments with TensorFlow and python Machine Learning related things.

Most (if not all) of the data sets come from the [UCI Machine Learning](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). They must be downloaded as needed because they are not included in this repository.

The "Setup" folder contains the Dockerfile I used to start the developer enviroment. Docker-compose does expect that this folder is to be renamed to "~/tfDir" so that it can mount this directory into the container.
