# Machine-Learning-Experiments

These are my personal experiments with TensorFlow and python Machine Learning related things.

Most (if not all) of the data sets come from the [UCI Machine Learning](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

The "Setup" folder contains the Dockerfile I used to start the developer enviroment.
